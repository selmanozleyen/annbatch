class DistributedSampler(Sampler):
    """Distributed chunk-based sampler that shards data across distributed processes.

    Partitions the full observation range into ``world_size`` contiguous shards
    using the ``mask`` mechanism of :class:`~annbatch.abc.Sampler`. Each rank receives a
    non-overlapping slice of the data. The shard boundaries are computed lazily
    when ``n_obs`` becomes known.

    When ``enforce_equal_batches`` is *True* (the default), the per-rank observation
    count is rounded down to the nearest multiple of ``batch_size``,
    guaranteeing that every rank yields exactly the same number of complete
    batches.

    Rank and world size are obtained from ``dist_info`` at construction time.
    The corresponding distributed framework must already be initialized.

    Example
    -------
    >>> from annbatch.samplers import DistributedSampler, RandomSampler
    >>> sampler = RandomSampler(
    ...     chunk_size=256,
    ...     preload_nchunks=4,
    ...     batch_size=32,
    ... )

    Using PyTorch distributed

    >>> dist_sampler = DistributedSampler(sampler, dist_info="torch")

    Using JAX

    >>> dist_sampler = DistributedSampler(sampler, dist_info="jax")

    Using a custom callable

    >>> dist_sampler = DistributedSampler(
    ...     sampler,
    ...     dist_info=lambda: (rank, world_size),
    ... )

    Parameters
    ----------
    sampler
        The :class:`~annbatch.abc.Sampler` to distribute. It is copied, so changes made to it
        after wrapping (``sampler.rng``, say) do not reach the copy. Its own ``mask`` is ignored:
        the copy spans the whole range and is restricted to this rank's shard only while a pass runs.
    dist_info
        How to obtain rank and world size.
        Either a string naming a distributed backend (``"torch"`` or ``"jax"``),
        or a callable that returns ``(rank, world_size)``.
    enforce_equal_batches
        If *True*, round each rank's observation count down to a multiple of ``batch_size`` so that all workers (ranks) yield the same number of batches.
        Set to *False* to use the raw ``n_obs // world_size`` split, which may result in an uneven number of batches per worker.
