class ClassSampler(Sampler):
    """Sample class-coherent batches with replacement.

    Every batch the :class:`~annbatch.Loader` yields is drawn from a single class:
    a class is drawn ``c ~ Categorical(p)`` (``p`` proportional to ``class_weights``,
    uniform by default) once per ``lcm(chunk_size, batch_size)`` rows, and every batch
    inside that block draws its observations from ``c``. A load request may span several
    classes but no batch mixes them, which makes over- or under-sampling specific
    populations straightforward.

    Sampling is **with replacement** -- each pass draws ``num_samples`` observations
    rather than partitioning a fixed epoch -- so there is no notion of an epoch and the
    number of iterations is fixed. The only size requirement is that
    ``chunk_size * preload_nchunks`` is divisible by ``batch_size`` (already enforced by the
    loader).

    *Class selection.* A class with a non-positive weight is excluded: it is
    never sampled and its runs are exempt from the run-length rule below. Set a
    weight to ``0`` to drop a class; there is no separate exclusion argument.

    *Run-length rule.* Every contiguous run of a *non-excluded* class must span
    at least ``chunk_size`` observations; otherwise no aligned slice fits inside it
    and the sampler raises at construction, naming the offending classes by their
    label.

    *Mask.* Assigning :attr:`mask` restricts sampling to a contiguous observation
    range ``[start, stop)``. The RLE is rebuilt over that window (slice starts stay
    in global coordinates) and cached on the resolved ``(start, stop)`` pair, so
    reassigning the same mask is free. Class weights are renormalized from the
    original values over only the classes present in the new range; if no
    class with a positive weight remains, the assignment raises. Assigning a different
    range while a pass is being iterated also raises, since a pass draws all of its
    slices when it starts.

    Multiple workers are not supported with this sampler.

    Implementation
    --------------
    A run-length encoding (RLE) of ``classes.codes`` is built over the :attr:`mask`
    range. A class boundary may only fall where a chunk edge and a batch edge coincide,
    which happens every ``lcm(chunk_size, batch_size)`` rows; so classes are assigned per
    *group* of ``group_chunks = batch_size // gcd(chunk_size, batch_size)`` chunks (one ``lcm``
    block) -- one class ``c ~ Categorical(p)`` is drawn independently for each group and
    shared across its chunks. Each chunk is then a single-class on-disk read and each batch
    falls inside one group, hence one class. Drawing per *minimal* group packs as many
    classes into a window as coherence allows: up to ``preload_nchunks // group_chunks``
    distinct classes (equivalently ``preload_nchunks * chunk_size // lcm(chunk_size,
    batch_size)``). ``preload_nchunks`` is always a multiple of ``group_chunks`` because
    ``chunk_size * preload_nchunks`` is divisible by ``batch_size``, so groups tile each window.
    A uniform chunk-start within ``c`` is drawn per chunk (a prefix-sum lookup maps it to the
    absolute slice in *O(log n_runs)*), and rows within each batch are shuffled, so batches are
    class-coherent but not ordered. Memory scales with the number of runs
    (``<= n_obs // chunk_size``).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from annbatch import Loader
    >>> from annbatch.samplers import ClassSampler
    >>> # Get categorical column from collection
    >>> classes = collection.obs(columns=["categories"])["categories"].values
    >>> sampler = ClassSampler(
    ...     chunk_size=10,
    ...     preload_nchunks=4,
    ...     batch_size=10,
    ...     classes=classes,
    ...     num_samples=1000,
    ... )
    >>> loader = Loader(batch_sampler=sampler).use_collection(collection)

    Parameters
    ----------
    chunk_size
        Number of observations in each slice yielded. Also the minimum run length
        required of every non-excluded class (see the run-length rule).
    preload_nchunks
        Number of chunks to load per iteration.
    batch_size
        Number of observations per batch. ``chunk_size * preload_nchunks`` must be divisible
        by it; it need not divide or be a multiple of ``chunk_size``, though only a multiple
        gives each batch its own class draw.
    classes
        A :class:`pandas.Categorical` with one entry per observation, e.g.
        ``df["cell_type"].values`` when the column already has a categorical dtype.
        If loading categories from a :class:`~annbatch.DatasetCollection`, they can be retrieved via
        ``collection.obs(columns=["cell_type"])["cell_type"].values`` (if the column was stored with categorical dtype)
        or converted using ``pd.Categorical(collection.obs(columns=["label"])["label"])`` (if stored as integers or strings).
        Length must equal the loader's ``n_obs``. The obs axis need not be contiguous per class, but
        every run of a non-excluded class must be at least ``chunk_size`` long
        (see the run-length rule above). NA values (``codes == -1``) are not allowed.
    num_samples
        Total number of observations to draw.
    class_weights
        Optional weights, one per class in ``classes.categories``
        (so ``len(class_weights) == len(classes.categories)``), controlling
        how often each class is drawn. A non-positive weight excludes that class
        entirely. When ``None`` (the default) every class is drawn uniformly. For
        proportional (≈ plain global random) sampling pass each class's observation
        count. The weights are kept and, whenever a mask narrows the range, the weights
        of the classes still present are renormalized.
    mask
        Optional contiguous observation range to restrict sampling to. Defaults to
        the whole dataset.
    drop_last
        Whether to drop the last incomplete batch.
    rng
        Random number generator. Note that :func:`torch.manual_seed` has no effect
        here; pass a seeded :class:`numpy.random.Generator` to control randomness.
